Hi, I'm Martino and I'm a self-taught web developer in Cagliari (Sardinia), but I work remotely most of the time.

I've studied electrical engineering and during those times I started working with wordpress websites and from 2010 I moved to Magento e-commerce.
I [co-wrote a book](https://store.magenio.com/magento-guida-pratica-all-uso.html) about using Magento as a store owner and I was a maintainer for the Italian Magento translation.

In December 2018 I found Gatsby and felt myself draw to Javascript and its ecosystem.
I started studying to build a solid Javascript basis and moved to React.js, node.js and MongoDB. I completed freecodecamp curriculumn and continued learning and coding!

I still can't find enough time to read all the fantastic resources available on the web and all the advice from twitter from other developers, I hope one day to help other new developers as they did with me, sharing their knowledge.

I like to read articles and books alike, tv series and a lot of rpg videogames (and many others).

Feel free to contact me even just to say hi, or [add me on steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198171809235) to play!
