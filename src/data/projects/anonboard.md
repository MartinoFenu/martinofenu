This anonymous message board is based on the freecodecamp challenge [build an Anonymous Message Board](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security-and-quality-assurance/information-security-and-quality-assurance-projects/anonymous-message-board).
Other than building the backend and its REST API, I built a React frontend bootstrapped with create react app, using axios to fetch data from a mongoDB database.
It is my frist project in the **MERN stack**
