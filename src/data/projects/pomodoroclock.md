A classic pomodoro clock, based on the freecodecamp challenge [Build a Pomodoro Clock](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock). It is my first attempt to use hooks and an implementation of PWA and desktop notification API. This is a frontend project built using React.js and bootstrapped using Create React App.
