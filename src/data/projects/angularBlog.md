This blog is made with Angular, the requirements and specifications are from a coding challenge for a real job interview. The challenge time was of one week, in this time I studied Angular and developed this code. It uses some external libraries, look at the readme on the GitHub page for more info! P.S.: the code review was positive, but still I didn't get the job :D
